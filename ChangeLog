2004-07-02 02:25:26  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@home.awesomeplay.com>

  * Version 0.30.

2004-06-11 17:42:29  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@home.awesomeplay.com>

  * Update version and NEWS for 0.30-rc1.

2004-06-07 03:14:25  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@home.awesomeplay.com>

  * The Thread class wasn't using GC::Collectable, so it wasn't
    getting its destructor called, which it currently needs.

2004-05-16 22:40:07  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@home.awesomeplay.com>

  * Update version stamp for AweMUD requires (to make sure the
    bug fix is included).

2004-05-16 22:36:19  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@home.awesomeplay.com>

  * Cleaned up the GC::Collectable code a bit.
  * Removed all explicit delete operators, not needed when we have
    a GC.
  * Added a new test, big.sx, whose pupose is to help find the
    "unexpected $end" bug that keeps popping up in AweMUD.
  * Used GC_MALLOC_UNCOLLECTABLE in lexer.ll and grammar.yy,
    which *appears* to fix the above bug.  Never can tell with
    this bug, though.

2004-04-30 18:04:50  Sean Middleditch <smiddle@civic.twp.ypsilanti.mi.us>

  * The gc_allocator.h file doesn't have include guards; wrap in
    our own.

2004-04-30 17:46:20  Sean Middleditch <smiddle@civic.twp.ypsilanti.mi.us>

  * So ya, we need to use AM_CONFIG_HEADER vs AC_CONFIG_HEADER.
    That little letter is pretty important there.  Automake sucks.
    :P

2004-04-23 18:42:59  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@home.awesomeplay.com>

  * Changed from the new_gc_alloc.h interface to the gc_allocator.h
    interface.
  * Moved Scriptix::Collectable to Scriptix::GC::Collectable.
  * Added some special wrappers for std::vector, std::list, and
    std::map to Scriptix::Collectable since the "new" standard
    complient C++ allocator interface is a complete pain in the ass.
  * Fixed a formed-ness error in bin/scriptix.cc (putting the type
    of a new[] operator call in paranthesis).

2004-04-17 14:46:04  Sean Middleditch <smiddle@civic.twp.ypsilanti.mi.us>

  * Const-ification of the API regarding Value pointers.
  * Added include/sysdep.h, needed because we can't include config.h
    in headers as it conflicts with embedders' config.h files.

2004-04-17 14:45:55  Sean Middleditch <smiddle@civic.twp.ypsilanti.mi.us>

  * Const-ification of the API regarding Value pointers.
  * Added include/sysdep.h, needed because we can't include config.h
    in headers as it conflicts with embedders' config.h files.

2004-03-31 03:34:03  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@home.awesomeplay.com>

  * Added all the missing headers.  Whoops.

2004-03-12 20:23:32  Sean Middleditch <smiddle@civic.twp.ypsilanti.mi.us>

  * Only include inttypes.h if the configure script indicates
    it's available.

2004-02-26 21:39:28  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * The symlink is just include/scriptix, not include/scriptix-0.

2004-02-26 21:30:46  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Split scriptix.h into a number of headers.
  * Added automatic symlink include/scriptix-0 to make the header
    includes work properly during build and after install.

2004-02-26 19:58:51  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Updated security levels to the final model.

2004-02-15 06:27:56  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

2004-02-13 21:01:22  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Fixed tools/Makefile.am to include the right script names.
  * Fixed lib/Makefile.am to not fail on building from grammar.yy.
  * Updated copyright years in COPYING.

2004-02-10 04:15:46  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Make the bootstrap script use the ACLOCAL_FLAGS environment
    variable.

2004-02-09 02:26:21  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Manage movement of gammar.cc.h to grammar.hh (for non C++
    friendly versions of Bison - thanks for changing output names
    with no way to control it, you jerks.)
  * Fixed tools/note.sh to get rid of GNU-isms.

2004-01-29 16:08:12  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Converted use of internally found int_t to C99 intptr_t.
  * Included inttypes.h in scriptix.h.
  * Use AC_HEADERS_STDC and AC_CHECK_TYPE(intptr_t) in configure.in.
  * Added SecurityLevel for holding permission flags.
  * Removed the SX_ prefix from any types or values which are
    already in the Scriptix namespace.
  * Added the CheckArgs() template utility functions for quick
    and easy checking of argument types.

2004-01-07 22:16:40  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Use xmlto instead of docbook-utils.
  * Finish rest of missing commit from versioning change.

2004-01-07 04:39:21  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Modified install paths and library names to match the excellent
    advice from http://ometer.com/parallel.html.

2004-01-05 21:47:28  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Do not force requirement on -ldl.

2003-12-16 16:59:22  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Fix Compare method to handle nil values a little better.

2003-12-15 18:49:03  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Removed the built-in pre-inc/post-inc operators.
  * Fixed a couple crashes caused by parser errors.

2003-12-08 17:17:32  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Fixed documentation install locations.
  * Added a COPY opcode.
  * The pre/post-increment/decrement and add/sub-assign all
    operators work on any lvalue now.
  * Added mult/div-assign operators.

2003-12-04 19:43:50  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Release 0.28.
  * Build fixes.

2003-11-21 16:49:58  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * The 'self' argument to type methods is automatic now.
    (Don't manually put it in the argument list.)
  * New constructs, .name=, .name, and .name() allow for easy
    member and method usage in the 'self' variable.  I.e., .foo='hi'
    is equivalent to self.foo='hi'.

2003-11-14 18:21:11  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Recode ID<->Name code to be much, much more efficient.
    (Names are stored in an STL set, and IDs are encoded pointers,
    resulting in very fast lookups both ways.)
  * Undid eval jump table lookup, compiler should optimize better
    than that.
  * Reorganized eval switch() statement to have numerically
    increasing opcodes, better compiler optimizations available.
  * Removed concat operator (deprecated it in the language),
    use the normal addition operator.
  * Addition will only work if the first arg is a number or string.
    (No, I don't care about the performance implications of doing
    this check.)  In the case of numbers, the second argument is
    *not* converted, but it is for strings.  As before with addition
    and as now still with other math operators, non-numbers given
    as the second operand in numeric addition will be interpreted
    as garbage, no conversion or checking is done.

2003-11-11 04:18:39  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Small fix to SX_TYPECREATE* for proper namespace usage.

2003-11-11 03:29:29  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Rewrote Method handling system to use Functions.
  * Threads are created with the System::CreateThread() method now.
  * The 'new' method of a object is called when the new operator is
    used in function form.  (i.e., new Object() or new Object(arg1,
    arg2))
  * Added blurb about bugs and backtrace generation to the README.

2003-11-10 19:00:23  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Type extends can now add static methods.
  * Types have a new Construct() method.
  * Can now create custom types in Scriptix, with or without
    base types.
  * Compiler handling of Types cleaned up.

2003-10-16 20:16:02  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * The script loading functions have been changed a bit to be
    more sane.

2003-10-16 15:33:46  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Cleanup to TagList (doesn't need to be GC'd).

2003-09-28 03:13:48  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Fix function tags to work again.

2003-09-26 21:00:44  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Deprecated the : notation for structs (use . now).
  * Removed the big select() in the VM for a computed goto (GCC
    extension - experimenting).
  * Various byte code cleanups and improvements.
  * s/Call/Frame.
  * Thread frames and data stack are STL vector<>s now.

2003-09-14 22:50:46  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Release 0.27.

2003-09-12 14:41:57  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * When reading source files, text mode is explicitly set,
    for Cygwin.

2003-08-29 18:58:42  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Require newer libsgc.  (*gasp*)

2003-08-11 19:57:46  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Int and String type casting uses automatic conversion.

2003-08-10 02:30:59  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Fixed IDToName to return the correct name.  (Off-by-error index
    error.)

  * Added .trim(), .ltrim(), and .rtrim() methods to String.

2003-08-01 16:44:23  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Methods may be Scriptix functions.
  * The extend syntax works now.

2003-08-01 15:23:57  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * More C++-ization to the compiler.
  * Added the type 'extend' grammer.  (Not yet working.)
  * Grammar fixes.

2003-07-31 18:42:16  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Types are once again dynamically registered with the System
    object.

2003-07-30 04:26:48  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Slight cleanups to eval() and return values.
  * Added exit() stdlib call.
  * Added Thread->Exit() (to implement exit()).

2003-07-29 00:24:10  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Remove --force from the automake command in the bootstrap
    script.

2003-07-26 18:18:30  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Use bootstrap, not autogen.sh.

2003-07-26 17:53:14  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Apparantly we must carry ltmain.sh.  Yay autotools.

2003-07-26 17:11:12  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Updated autogen.sh to work in Cygwin.

2003-07-26 01:21:27  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Actually, like, you know, _test_ the changes and make sure
    they work...

2003-07-26 01:13:44  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Fix to library order for static linking fixes.  (For Cygwin)

2003-07-16 02:24:36  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

    be delete'd.

2003-07-16 00:57:04  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * System::WaitOn's retval is a full value now.

2003-06-16  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Scriptix will find the numeric type with sizeof== sizeof(void*),
    instead of requiring sizeof(long)==sizeof(void*).  This will
    probably help portability a good deal.

2003-06-13  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * String type now uses std::string for better C++ memory usage.
    (String methods could probably use some optimizing for the C++
    std::string daatype now.)

2003-06-11  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Small header fix for compilation.

2003-05-31  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Finished stage 1 of compiler cleanup.

2003-05-22  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Tons of work simplifying compiler.

2003-05-22  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Began adding op arg support (so there's no need to use the
    data stack so much).

2003-05-21  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Jump operator uses relative distances now.  (Pita to debug,
    let me tell you...)

2003-05-21  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>


2003-05-20  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * FreeBSD fixes.

2003-03-22  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Fixed make dist.

2003-03-22  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Switched to using Automake/Libtool for building.  Ouch.

  * Broke list functionality (in array and assoc) into a separate
    List class.

  * Added new operators to Array and Assoc.

2003-03-07  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Began documenting API.

2003-03-07  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

    pain without it (outside the core engine).
  * Added bin/scriptix.cc, removed bin/scriptix.c.

2003-03-06  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

2003-02-18  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Rewrote in C++.
  * Still in need of some fixes and further API cleanups.
  * WARNING: This will *NOT* work with AweMUD in any way, the
    whole API has changed.

2003-02-06  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Compressed byte-code space.

2003-01-22  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Added a String.subtr() method.

2003-01-16  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

    will run cooperatively, not pre-emptively.

2003-01-11  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Improved parse error handling.
  * Renamed some symbol types in compiler for error output (yay
    Bison and ugly output).

2003-01-03  Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awemud.net>

  * Began using a ChangeLog.
