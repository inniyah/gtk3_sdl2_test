Scriptix :: The lite-weight extension language
See the file COPYING, which should have come with this distribution, for

Scriptix is a simple extension language (not to be confused with a full-scale
programming language).  The intent of Scriptix is to allow easy, fast,
and powerful scripting support for any application.

The list of current Scriptix features include:

	C/C++/Java -like syntax
	Basic integer and string data types
	Local/global Variables
	User and C++ functions
	Lists/arrays
	Garbage collection
	Fully OO
	While/until/do/for loops and blocks
	Extensible class/type system thru C++

Planned/future features (i.e. Todo list):

	Documentation
	Advanced thread control
	A moderate standard library, useful for simple embedding purposes
	Regular expressions
	Floating-point and bignum support

Features you won't likely see, ever, as they are unnecessary overkill:

	Script-defined operator overloading
	Virtual variables
	Weird/unusual built-in datatypes
	OS/System interfaces
	Massively large standard library/type system

Model:
Scriptix is based on a byte-code interpreter.  The compiler parses the input
into a parse tree.  This is then run thru an optimization system.  Then the
trimmed/pruned/optimized tree is run thru a code generator.

Types:
Types are fairly simple.  A type is nothing more than a name, a collection
of methods, and a parent type.

An object can be created.  Each object inherits from a type.  An object is
generally just a collection of members.  Methods, or type functions, are part
of the types themselves, and can be defined on a per-type basis only.

In addition, each core type can define additional parameters/members of an
instance.  For example, you could create a special core type for containing
references to a custom C datatype, and then add methods to the type for
interacting with the data type.

Scriptix code can derive types from core type, or make custom "bare"
types.  A bare type would be nothing more than a collection of methods -
no operator overloading or other special functionality.

A derived type based on a core type can be made to do a number of
interesting things, depending on the core type.  A derived type cannot
overload a core type's operator overloading code, however, the total
usefulness *is* limited.  This shouldn't be too much of an issue given
Scriptix' problem domain, however.
