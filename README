Basic Scriptix Information
------------------------------------------------------


1. Introduction
   ============
   Scriptix is a scripting system coded in C++, designed solely for embedding
   in other C++ applications.  Scriptix doesn't pretend to be a stand-alone
   language.

   The language is based loosely on C++, Java, and C#.  Scriptix is a
   dynamically typed language.  (Meaning you don't declare
   variable/argument/return types.)  Scriptix is heavily OO based, however.

   Scriptix is intended to be fast, tho it isn't as fast as it could be.  (The
   older C version was much faster, due to better optimizations in the system.)


2. Features
   ========
   Scriptix is an object-oriented language.  Classes/types can only be defined
   from with the embedding application using the C++ API.

   Scriptix provides several core types, including Numbers (31-bit signed
   integers only, currently), Strings, Arrays, Structs, and Functions.

   New functions may be defined in scripts, and may be defined public.  Public
   functions are accessible to any other source file that is loaded afterwards,
   while non-public functions are only accessible to the source file they were
   declared in.

   All basic operations are supported, including math, string concatenation,
   array indexing, and so forth.

   Scriptix is threadable; it uses it's own (simplistic) threading interface to
   allow multiple scripts to be running at the same time.  Threads can be
   either cooperatively or pre-emptively threaded.  Cooperative threads must
   give up control explicitly, while pre-emptive threads have control taken
   away after a set number of instructions have been executed.


3. Documentation
   =============
   Yes, we're seriously lacking it.
